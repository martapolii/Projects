        <h3>Russia's Invasion on Ukraine</h3>
        <blockquote>
            "On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that started in 2014. The invasion became the largest attack on a European country since World War II" - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine#:~:text=On%2024%20February%202022%2C%20Russia,country%20since%20World%20War%20II."><small>Wikipedia contributors, 2024

        <p>
            On February 24, 2022, months after Putin begin mobilizing troops at the Ukrainian border under the guise of a non-aggressive "special military operation," airstrikes and ballistic missles rained down on the Ukrainian cities of Kharkiv, Odesa, Kharkiv and Donbas. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This is an escalation of the war that had started back in 2014. This war has now been raging on for over 2 years, with Ukraine not daring to back down. The horrors and atrocities committed have left a deep scar in all Ukrainians.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Russiaâ€™s deliberate attacks on civilian infrastructure has currently left <span class="importantText">over 6 million</span> Ukrainians displaced. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The stress of the war has severely impacted all Ukrainians. Our hearts are breaking every day for our home, our beautiful country, and the innocent lives lost.
