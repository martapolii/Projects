    <h3>What is Stress and Why is it Affecting the Ukrainian Population?</h3>
    <blockquote>A study carried out 9-12 months after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 found that stress, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms among adult Ukrainians had significantly increased in comparison to before the war. - <a target="blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(23)00192-8/fulltext#:~:text=Zhang%20S.X.-,Mental%20health%20symptoms%20and%20coping%20strategies%20among%20Ukrainians%20during%20the,Ukraine%20war%20in%20March%202022.&text=In%20April%202022%2C%2030.8%25%20of,a%20significant%20difference%20between%20groups."><small>Lushchak et al., 2024

        <div class="maininfo">
            <p>
                The results show that 93% of those surveyed had moderate-to-severe mental health problems, compared to only 20.8–27.7% before the invasion.  Those who were able to stay in their homes showed lower levels of these symptoms in comparison to refugees, who showed the highest levels of distress.
            </p>
            <p>
                When compared to data from previous years, the prevalence of stress and anxiety among Ukrainians steadily increased, with a significant peak after the invasion. Internally displaced people (IDPs) and refugees experienced particularly severe mental health problems, particularly PTSD. Unfortunately, IDPs lack access to mental health services, with the majority not receiving any at all.

            <h4>What is stress?</h4>
                <p>
                    Stress is a natural reaction of the body to positive or negative stressors experienced in day-to-day life or during significant life events. Stress triggers the body’s “fight-or-flight response,” which helps us adapt to certain situations. It arouses our nervous system, keeping us alert and ready for danger. But, being chronically stressed can have severe negative impacts on us over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chronic stress can manifest as physical and mental symptoms, which can include: 
                </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pain in the body </li>
                <li>Headaches</li>
                <li>Chest pain</li>
                <li>High blood pressure </li>
                <li>Gastrointestinal problems</li>
                <li>A weakened immune system</li>
                <li>Anxiety</li>
                <li>Depression </li>
                <li>Panic attacks</li>
                <li>PTSD</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            There is a critical need for mental health services for those affected by the invasion of Ukraine, both domestically and internationally, to address the negative effects of exposure to conflict and displacement on mental health.
